# Hello and Welcome to my React App
I am currently working on this React app to help strengthen my skills fetching _APIs_** with _JavaScript_**.
My main goal is to create an app where the user can enter a city name and get the current weather  
in that city.  
Working on this project will also help me learn how to implement conditional images to an app.

This will be possible using the fetch function in JavaScript.
```javascript
const getWeather = () => {
    fetch('ENTER_URL');
}; 
```
